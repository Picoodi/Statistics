# Statistics
This codebase contains classes for random variables and the binominal distribution. The code was built to help me and my classmates to check our experiments and calculations in math class. Because I went to school in germany the function names are german but I will comment everything in englisch and also this ReadMe will be in Englisch.

### Translations
Here are the best translations for the german words i could find.

 
Binominalverteilung -> Binominal distribution  
Erwartngswert -> Expected value  
Histogramm -> Histogram     
kumulative Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung -> Cumulative Probability distribution    
Stabdiagramm -> Bar diagram  
Standardabweichung -> Standard deviation       
Tabelle ->Table    
Treppenfunktion -> Staircase function   
Varianz -> Variance     
Wahrscheinlichkeitsverteilung -> Probability distribution   
Zufallsgröße -> RandomVariables   

# Needed Libraries 
Check that you have the following librairies installed. They are needed for the mathematics and valuable and good looking outputs.
```pyhton
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from math import sqrt, factorial
from prettytable import PrettyTable
from binarytree import build 
```
